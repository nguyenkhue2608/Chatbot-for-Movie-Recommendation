   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` file and add your Azure OpenAI configuration:
   ```
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name_here
   ```
3. Get these values from your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal

### 4. Run the Application
